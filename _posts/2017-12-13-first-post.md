Introducing something new! A blog for ChatterBot.

I'm extremely excited for this blog to be the next step in
the growing list of resources available to the community
of developers using ChatterBot.

In the months to come, the theme of the blog posts will
involve community project highlights, announcements about
exciting or important code changes, and guides for cool
projects that can be made using ChatterBot.

Anyone is welcome to propose an idea for a blog post topic.
This can be done by opening an issue on
[the blog's GitHub page](https://github.com/ChatterBot/blog.chatterbot.us/issues).
You can also vote for existing blog post ideas by adding a
üëç or üëé reaction on the GitHub issue. Blog posts with more
votes will be prioritized to be written sooner.

Thank you for your continued support!
